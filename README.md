# ECG_Classification
My final year project based upon the classification of electrocardiogram signals using deep neural networks and the introduction of simulated data into training sets used to train these networks.

## Goal Project
The goal of this project is to create a deep neural network able to classify ECG signals and cardiac arrhythmia with a high degree of accuracy. Alongside this goal is the aim to explore the implications of introducing simulated data into the training sets in hopes of improving the overall accuracy of the model.

The simulated data will be created using a model of delay differential equations proposed by [Cheffer and Savi](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0303264720300769) with the ability to replicate cardiac arrhythmias we see in the real world.

### Why simulated data ?
